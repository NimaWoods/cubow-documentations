### Examples

#### Creating a Giveaway

To create a giveaway, use the `/creategiveaway` command with the required options:

```plaintext
/creategiveaway gewinn:"Awesome Prize" winner:1 seconds:0 minutes:30 hours:0 days:0 channel:#giveaways
```

This command creates a giveaway with the prize "Awesome Prize" in the `#giveaways` channel, which will last for 30 minutes and have 1 winner.

## Giveaway Workflow

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Start a Giveaway**: Use the `/creategiveaway` command to initiate a new giveaway. Specify the prize, number of winners, duration, and the channel where the giveaway message should be sent.

   Example:
    ```plaintext
    /creategiveaway gewinn:"Gaming Headset" winner:1 seconds:0 minutes:0 hours:1 days:0 channel:#giveaways
    ```

   This command creates a giveaway for a "Gaming Headset" that lasts for 1 hour and is announced in the `#giveaways` channel.

2. **Join a Giveaway**: Users can join the giveaway by clicking the "ðŸŽ‰ Join" button on the giveaway message. Their user ID will be stored in a `users.json` file.

3. **End a Giveaway**: The bot will automatically end the giveaway after the specified duration. A winner will be randomly selected from the `users.json` file, and an announcement will be made in the giveaway channel.

4. **Announce the Winner**: The bot will edit the giveaway message to announce the winner and ping them in the channel.
