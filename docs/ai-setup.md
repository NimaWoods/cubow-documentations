Cubow is able to use AI Features in direct request or in his ticket system. Here ist a breakdown how to setup these features:

### Set API Key
First you have to set an api key yourself. Just go [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys). Now use /options chatgpt_api_token <chatgpt_api_token> to set the token.

### define a prompt for the tickets
Cubow can answer on Tickets for you but you have to give him a prompt. Use /options chatgpt_prompt <chatgpt_prompt> to give him this prompt.
