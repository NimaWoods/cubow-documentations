# Ticket System Documentation

## Overview
The CubowBot Ticket System allows users to submit support requests or other inquiries in a structured and organized manner. The system supports the creation, management, and closure of tickets, as well as communication between members and moderators.

## Main Components and Functions

The main class for managing tickets. It includes functionality for creating, editing, and closing tickets, managing permissions, and sending notifications.

### Key Functions

#### Ticket Creation
The system enables the creation of a ticket by checking the user's permissions and, if authorized, generating a new ticket channel with the appropriate settings and roles. A button can be used to trigger this process.

#### Dashboard Panel
A dashboard panel for ticket creation can be sent to a predefined channel, allowing users to easily create new tickets.

#### Adding and Removing Members
Moderators can add members to an existing ticket, granting them access to the ticket channel. They can also remove members from the ticket, revoking their access.

#### Ticket Closure
Tickets can be closed by the creator or a moderator. The system confirms the closure, archives the ticket, and notifies the relevant parties. Closure requests can be made, and confirmations are handled through user interaction.

#### Claiming and Unclaiming Tickets
Moderators can take responsibility for a ticket, assigning it to themselves and updating permissions. They can also release responsibility, making the ticket available for others to claim.

#### Transferring Tickets
Responsibility for a ticket can be transferred from one member to another, updating permissions accordingly.

#### Transcript Creation
When a ticket is closed, the system creates a transcript of all messages in the ticket channel. This transcript is sent to a defined transcript channel, ensuring that records of the conversation are maintained.

### Usage Examples

#### Creating a Ticket
A user clicks on the "Create Ticket" button. The system checks permissions and, if successful, creates a new ticket channel with appropriate settings.

#### Adding a Member
Moderators can use the system to add a member to an existing ticket, giving them access to the channel.

#### Closing a Ticket
To close a ticket, a confirmation process is initiated. Once confirmed, the ticket is archived, and a transcript is created.

#### Claiming a Ticket
Moderators can claim a ticket to take responsibility for it. The ticket is then assigned to them, and the necessary permissions are updated.

#### Transcript Creation
Upon ticket closure, a complete transcript of the ticket channel's messages is generated and sent to a predefined transcript channel.
